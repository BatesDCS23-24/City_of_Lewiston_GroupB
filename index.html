            <b>Premise</b>: In our project, we were able to use data on the Kennedy Park Pool provided to us by the 
            City of Lewiston to generate a very informative map that contained the information of the residences of 
            the users of the pool. It is hoped that this map will provide the city government and the recreation department 
            with insights into the users of the pool. By this notion, it is presumed that similar maps could be made for 
            every program that the recreation department is in charge of; the analysis of the maps could be used to entice 
            different populations, based on their location throughout Lewiston, into their programs through targeted advertising 
            purposes. Thus, a program was devised so that data, of a similar style as the data provided to us about the users of 
            the Kennedy Park Pool, could be uploaded so that a map of the users for a specific program would be created. The original
            students working on this project, Carlos, Katie, Quinn, and Jamil, may no longer be available to run this program for their 
            community partners in Lewiston City Hall, so this program as a product of this project manifests an ideal of sustainability 
            common in a design justice setting. Throughout this data guide, it is hoped that the necessary information for said 
            program is highlighted and explained, not only for the partners working for the City but any future collaborators. <br><br>

            <b>Data Format</b>: The program created requires files of a ".xlxs" format, which is common in Excel Spreadsheets and Google Sheets. <br><br>

            <b>Column Headings</b>: A screenshot is placed below, taken from the data of the Kennedy Park Pool so that it is clear to the format of the 
            data necessary for the program. Each column name should have the first letter capitalized and be written as follows: Program Name, 
            Event Name, Activity Name, Grade, Gender, Address, Address 2, City, State, and Zip Code.<br><br>

            <b>Program Name</b>: To keep track of program attendance, input the name of the recreational program. For example, in the Kennedy Park 
            Pool data, the Program Name was "Kennedy Park Pool Membership." In the mock data set we created for the Basketball league at 
            the Armory, we imputed the Program Name as "Armory Basketball."<br><br>

            <b>Event Name</b>: This column is dedicated to programs that have a specific event name. For example, adding to our mock data about 
            recreational basketball, since there are different age groups, the age group of the league can be added to this column to keep 
            track of the participants for each specific program.<br><br>

            <b>Activity Name</b>: This column is used for organization as the activity name is assumed to be the same as the Program Name. In the 
            Kennedy Park Pool Data, both the Program Name and Activity Name was "Kennedy Park Pool Membership."<br><br>

            <b>Grade</b> : This column contains the grade of the participant to keep track of the number of participants in each grade to get a 
            better understanding of what ages the programs better reached. For the data to work with the code, the grade should be inputted 
            as a number for grades 1-12, PK of pre-kindergarten, and K for kindergarten.<br><br>
