                During this semester, our group worked on developing a tool that would give insights into the attendance and reach of the Kennedy Pool programs. 
                With basic data collected, we were able to develop a Python program that would make use of API in order to get geospatial data based on the 
                addressess provided for pool registration. With this data we were able to generate interactive maps and diagrams in order to show what areas 
                and groups were being reached by the Kennedy Pool. <br><br>

                At the later stages of the course, we focused on expanding the program, in order to be able to process data from other activities or clubs that 
                might be run by the City of Lewiston. In addition we developed a Data Acquisition and Formatting Guide, to serve as reference on how data Acquisition
                on event registration or attendance could be implemented without sophisticated equipment. <br><br>

                The overaching goal of this proyect, and the guide for future work on this program is the development of a tool that serves the City of Lewiston
                take informed decision about the inlcusive and equitable reach of their community activities.

            After extracting registered data on the participants who annually attend or visit Kennedy Pool, we have examined 19 different census tracts 
            that comprise 625 members from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, presenting an overall diverse demographic. Scrutinizing the financial 
            composition of each of these tracts, we observe that relative poverty is extremely prevalent in these areas, with many homes producing an
            annual income under $10,000. An accentuating correlation we observe is the increasing number of poverty-stricken households in these areas, 
            leading to a rise in the number of young adults aged 16-19 who have dropped out of school and/or are unemployed.<br><br>

            Upon further analysis, another noteworthy insight emerges: the tracts with a greater number of pool visitors also exhibit a higher level of 
            poverty and a heightened dropout rate. Interestingly, this trend may be attributed to the population density in a specific neighborhood rather
            than implying a direct correlation. Additionally, it is essential to consider external factors that may contribute to these patterns, such as 
            regional economic conditions and educational resources. Furthermore, future investigations could delve into the potential impact of community 
            programs or interventions on mitigating these challenges in high-poverty areas.

            <b>Premise</b>: In our project, we were able to use data on the Kennedy Park Pool provided to us by the City of Lewiston to generate 
            a very informative map that contained the information of the residences of the users of the pool. It is hoped that this map will provide 
            the city government and the recreation department with insights into the users of the pool. By this notion, it is presumed that similar 
            maps could be made for every program that the recreation department is in charge of; the analysis of the maps could be used to entice 
            different populations, based on their location throughout Lewiston, into their programs through targeted advertising purposes. Thus, a
             program was devised so that data, of a similar style as the data provided to us about the users of the Kennedy Park Pool, could be 
             uploaded so that a map of the users for a specific program would be created. The original students working on this project, Carlos, 
             Katie, Quinn, and Jamil, may no longer be available to run this program for their community partners in Lewiston City Hall, so this 
             program as a product of this project manifests an ideal of sustainability common in a design justice setting. Throughout this data guide,
             it is hoped that the necessary information for said program is highlighted and explained, not only for the partners working for the City 
             but any future collaborators. 
            <br><br>

            <b>Data Format</b>: The program created requires files of a ".xlxs" format, which is common in Excel Spreadsheets and Google Sheets. <br><br>

            <b>Column Headings</b>: A screenshot is placed below, taken from the data of the Kennedy Park Pool so that it is clear to the format of the 
            data necessary for the program. Each column name should have the first letter capitalized and be written as follows: Program Name, 
            Event Name, Activity Name, Grade, Gender, Address, Address 2, City, State, and Zip Code.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; margin: 0;">

            <b>Program Name</b>: To keep track of program attendance, input the name of the recreational program. For example, in the Kennedy Park 
            Pool data, the Program Name was "Kennedy Park Pool Membership." In the mock data set we created for the Basketball league at 
            the Armory, we imputed the Program Name as "Armory Basketball."<br><br>

            <b>Event Name</b>: This column is dedicated to programs that have a specific event name. For example, adding to our mock data about 
            recreational basketball, since there are different age groups, the age group of the league can be added to this column to keep 
            track of the participants for each specific program.<br><br>

            <b>Activity Name</b>: This column is used for organization as the activity name is assumed to be the same as the Program Name. In the 
            Kennedy Park Pool Data, both the Program Name and Activity Name was "Kennedy Park Pool Membership."<br><br>

            <b>Grade</b> : This column contains the grade of the participant to keep track of the number of participants in each grade to get a 
            better understanding of what ages the programs better reached. For the data to work with the code, the grade should be inputted 
            as a number for grades 1-12, PK of pre-kindergarten, and K for kindergarten.<br><br>

            <b>Address</b>: This column is very important for the code that is used to create the map, so participants should enter their address by putting 
            their house number and then the street name. An example of this would be "27 Pine St."<br><br>

            <b> Address 2</b>:  Used for apartment numbers, this column is not being analyzed through the code; the Address column is the one where the address
             of the building belongs. An example of this would be "APT 2."<br><br>

            <b>City</b> This column should contain the city in which the participants live. <br><br>

            <b>State</b>: This column should contain the state in which the participants live. The format for this column should be the abbreviation of the state. 
            For example, "ME" would be used if the participants lived in Maine. <br><br>

            <b>Zip Code</b>: This column should contain the zip code where the participants live. <br><br>

            As part of the extension of this project to be able to generate activity reports for this other of the city's clubs and activities, the code was modified in 
            order to intake data from other activities. As an example the program used mock data for a City of Lewiston Basketball and Chess club, to serve as a proof
            of concept of how other activities could be incorporated in the future. This would help future work on the project, as the program is now able to intake data 
            from other activities.
