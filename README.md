# Lewiston Recreation Mapping 

## Description
During this semester, our group worked on developing a tool that would give insights into the attendance and reach of the Kennedy Pool
programs. With basic data collected, we were able to develop a Python program that would make use of API in order to get geospatial data
based on the addressess provided for pool registration. With this data we were able to generate interactive maps and diagrams in order to 
show what areas and groups were being reached by the Kennedy Pool.

## Installation
- The project requires two shapefiles/directories in the repo: maine_census_tracts and maine_block_groups.zip
    - These files were obtained from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)
 
- The project utilizes Demographic data obstained from Social Explorer -  Social Explorer Dataset (SE), Census 2000 on 2010 Geographies, Social Explorer; U.S. Census Bureau.
  The demographic indicators used in the project include:

    - SE:T53. School Enrollment for the Population 3 Years and Over![image](https://github.com/BatesDCS23-24/City_of_Lewiston_GroupB/assets/107200037/98ab270e-f480-4d0a-bd78-174b4fe2df0f)


## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook is orga

## Functions
### `clean_data(event_file)`
- Cleans data from an Excel file.
- Parameters:
  - `event_file`: Excel Filename.
- Returns:
  - `pd.DataFrame`: Cleaned event data used throughout the notebook.

### `geocode_addresses(df, user_agent)`
- Geocodes addresses in a DataFrame and adds latitude and longitude columns.
- Parameters:
  - `df (pd.DataFrame)`: DataFrame containing addresses.
  - `user_agent (str)`: User agent for geocoding service.
- Returns:
  - `pd.DataFrame`: DataFrame with added latitude and longitude columns.

### `census_tract_map(event_name, event_coords, census_shapefile_path, demographic_data_path)`
- Creates a Folium map with census tract boundaries.
- Parameters:
  - `event_name (str)`: Name of the event.
  - `event_coords (pd.DataFrame)`: DataFrame containing pool coordinates.
  - `census_shapefile_path (str)`: Path to census TRACT shapefile.
  - `demographic_data_path (str)`: Specific demographic data filepath.
- Returns:
  - `folium.Map`: Folium map.

### `census_blockgroup_map(event_name, event_coords, census_blockg_shapefile_path)`
- Creates a Folium map with census block group boundaries.
- Parameters:
  - Similar to `census_tract_map`.

### `demographs_graphs(event_data)`
- Generates graphs showing gender and grade distribution for the visitors.
- Parameters:
  - `event_data (pd.DataFrame)`: DataFrame containing event coordinates.
- Returns:
  - Tuple containing graphs for gender and grade (`go.Figure`).
